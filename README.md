# Mapping-a-Geological-Contact
This project focuses on identifying the contact between the Exeter Diorite and the Eliot Formation at the UNH Horticulture Farm. Using pace and compass mapping alongside strike and dip measurements, the study identifies the boundary as an intrusive contact, demonstrating how field mapping reveals the relationship between different rock bodies.
